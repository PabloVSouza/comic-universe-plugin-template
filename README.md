## What is this for?

This project is a base template for creating comic repositories for the app [**Comic Universe**](https://github.com/pablovsouza/comic-universe).

Feel free to fork this repository and start developing your own plugin, just following the typescript interfaces provided, as well as **being compatible with NPM**.

Please avoid using unnecessary dependencies, as it would make the main app heavier.

### How can i test the plugin?

Comic Universe (Only on version 2.0 onwards) will look for the folder called **plugins**, inside the **comic-universe** folder, on the following path:

- On Macs, its "**~/library/application-support/comic-universe/plugins**"
- On Windows, its "**%appdata%/comic-universe/plugins**"

Just put your plugin folder there and the app should recognize the files.

**Make sure to fill the package.json properly, so the app can use it's metadata.**

### What if i'm stuck?

Feel free to reach me on the social networks provided above, as well as in our discord server.

### I'm done developing my plugin, how do i publish it?

Reach me in the discord server, on the channel **#plugin-submission**.
